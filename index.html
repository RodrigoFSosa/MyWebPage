          <h3>Research and Analysis</h3>
          <p>My interest in science began in my teens, and increased when I started to study Physics, I really enjoyed the degree and the opportunity to improve in their disciplines. </p>
          <p>This includes being able to reason well, define and review the work of others, examine a large volume of data and identify trends, apply abstract theories or concepts, and then design a research project to adequately solve the problem.</p>
